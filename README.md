# SpellingBeeSolver

The New York Times has a weekly puzzle known as the Spelling Bee, in which readers must form words given 7 letters arranged in a "honeycomb." 
Words must be at least 5 letters long, and must contain the letter in the middle of the honeycomb. 
Words are 1 point unless they contain all 7 letters, in which case they are 3 points. 
This code uses a Scrabble dictionary dataset to form all possible 5+ letter words after recieving user input on the essential letter and other letters.

Note: Written using Python.
